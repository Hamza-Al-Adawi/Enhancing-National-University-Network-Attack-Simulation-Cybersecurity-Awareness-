🔐 Enhancing National University Network Security
Attack Simulation & Cybersecurity Awareness

📋 About the Project

This project focuses on enhancing network security and cybersecurity awareness at National University of Science and Technology (NU), Oman through the design of a Cybersecurity Awareness Training Lab using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Developed as a diploma project at Middle East College, Oman, the lab simulates a real-world enterprise network and allows users to safely experience cyberattacks, security misconfigurations, and defense mechanisms. The main objective is to bridge the gap between theoretical cybersecurity knowledge and practical, hands-on skills.
